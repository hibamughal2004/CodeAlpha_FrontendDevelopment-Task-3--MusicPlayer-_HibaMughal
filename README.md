* How It Works: 
The HTML file creates the structure of the music player, including the audio element, buttons for play, pause, stop, and a list of tracks. 
The CSS file adds styling to the player, including layout, colors, button hover effects, and typography. 
The JavaScript file adds interactivity. It listens for user clicks on the buttons and track list items to control the audio playback. It dynamically updates the currently playing track and allows users to switch between songs.
